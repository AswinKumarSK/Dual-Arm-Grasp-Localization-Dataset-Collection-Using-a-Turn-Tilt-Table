# Design and Implementation of Turn-Tilt Table For Automated Dual Arm Grasp Localization Dataset collection

### This project aims at developing a turn-tilt table for capturing the human fingersâ€™ (index and thumb) pose automatically by integrating multi-sensory data to prepare a dataset containing annotations required for a deep learning approach in a dual arm manipulator-based grasp localization scenario. The dataset preparation is aimed to be carried out in a human imitated approach by allowing different people to attempt to grasp objects with two fingers and two hands.
